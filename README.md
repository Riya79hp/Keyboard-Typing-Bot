# Keyboard-Typing-Bot
ü§ñ Voice-Controlled Mechanical Typing System
Overview
This innovative system receives voice commands for typing and employs a mechanical arm to physically press keys on the keyboard, achieving an accuracy rate of 70%. The system operates with a response time of 0.2 seconds between receiving commands and executing them.

Features
üó£Ô∏è Voice Command Recognition: Harnesses the power of Python for natural language processing (NLP), enabling the recognition and interpretation of voice commands.
ü¶æ Mechanical Arm Typing: Utilizes Arduino for controlling the robotic arm, enabling precise and coordinated movements in response to processed voice commands using servo motors.
‚å®Ô∏è Physical Key Pressing: The mechanical arm physically presses keys on the keyboard, simulating human typing.
‚ö° Fast Response Time: Operates with a response time of 0.2 seconds from receiving voice commands to executing them.
Tech Stack
Python: Used for natural language processing (NLP) to recognize and interpret voice commands.
Arduino: Controls the robotic arm and enables precise, coordinated movements.
Servo Motors: Provide the mechanical movement necessary for typing.
NLP Libraries: Python libraries such as SpeechRecognition for voice command processing.
Hardware Components: Arduino board, servo motors, and a mechanical arm.
